//From chapter 16 onwards, it seemed like I started to get acquainted with the native C++ library instead of keys, structures, and functions
//Most of these libraries are important because they are standard libraries
//they will contribute as key work of c++
//vector and arr will be the first stop

#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main(){
    std::vector<int> arr {2, 4, 5};  

    std::cout<<arr[1];
    return 0;
